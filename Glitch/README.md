Hello! 

This program is an example of glitch art as it intentionally creates unexpected
and unconventional visual outcomes by manipulating digital media through code.
Glitch art is often used to highlight subverted human purpose, where the outcome
is not what the creator intended, but rather a new modified creation that
emerges as a symptom of our interaction with technology, time, and the glitch.
The program works by applying various random glitches to the live video feed,
creating a distorted and disorienting experience for the viewer. The source
material of the program, the live video feed captured by the webcam, relates to
the overall message of the work by embodying the concept of technology and how
our interaction with it can result in unpredictable outcomes.
The glitch filters applied to the media through the code further emphasize the
ferality of glitches, where they are wild and uncontrolled, subverting our
expectations of what the media should look like. At the same time, the program's
structured code and intentional application of glitches can also be seen as a
domestication of glitches, where they are harnessed and utilized for artistic
purposes.
The delay between the flash and the output in this program is an intentional
feature that subverts our expectations of technology. We expect technology to
behave in a certain way, and when it doesn't, we are often frustrated or
confused. By introducing a delay between the flash and the output, this program
highlights the gap between our expectations and the reality of the technology
we use. This gap between expectation and reality can be seen as a symptom of our
interaction with technology. We often take for granted the seamless functioning
of technology in our daily lives, and the glitch reminds us that technology is
not perfect, nor is it a natural or neutral force. Technology is created and
designed by humans, and as such, it reflects our values, biases, and
limitations. The glitch also highlights the creative potential of subverting and
modifying existing technologies. By intentionally introducing errors and
glitches into the system, we can create new and unexpected forms of media that
challenge our assumptions and expectations. This creative process can be seen
as a form of domestication of glitches, where we harness the unexpected and
unpredictable behavior of technology to produce new and unique results.
